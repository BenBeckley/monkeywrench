        The scheduler runs every 5 minutes on the database server and:</p>
    <p>
        * Checks source control for new revisions.</p>
    <p>
        * For each new revision, loops through all hosts and schedules work to the 
        database.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The builder runs every minute on the client and:</p>
    <p>
        * Exits if another builder is already running.</p>
    <p>
        * Checks database for work, if so, goes ahead and executes that.</p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Work</p>
    <p>
        * Consists of a command to execute. Every lane has a list of of files, the 
        command would typically be to execute any of those files.</p>
    <p>
        * Two special flags can be set:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Always execute: should be executed even if any previous work failed (typical 
            usage would be for cleanup).&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Nonfatal: doesn&#39;t prevent any subsequent work from being executed (typical usage 
            would be for tests).</li>
    </ul>
